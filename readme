## Usage

Require the package in your code:

Provide the necessary details and call the sendOtpEmail function:

const senderEmail = 'your-email@example.com';
const senderPassword = 'your-email-password';
const recipientEmail = 'recipient-email@example.com';
const subject = 'OTP Verification';

sendOtpEmail(senderEmail, senderPassword, recipientEmail, subject)
  .then((response) => {
    console.log(response.message);
  })

    console.error('Error:', error);
  });
  
Make sure to replace your-email@example.com with your actual sender email, your-email-password with the password of your sender email, recipient-email@example.com with the recipient's email address, and OTP Verification with your desired subject.
